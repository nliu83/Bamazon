# Bamazon

## Overview

* This App is a basic version of Amazon (online shopping) storefront that will allow customers to view inventory and 'purchase' products with the help of mySQL. 

* First the program will display the list of products along with their item-id and price. Then, it will ask the user to select the product and the quantity they would like to 'purchase'

* The user should enter the item_id (number) along with the quantity (number) that they would like to purchase. 

* The program will check if the quantity of inventory and compare it to the requested quantity of the item_id selected. If the requested quantity is greater than the inventory quantity, then the program will inform the user of 'Insufficient Quantity'. 

* If there is sufficient quantity, then we will go ahead and 'make the purchase' and update the database with the new inventory quantity.
